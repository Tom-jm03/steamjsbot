# Steam/CS:GO JS Bot
A Steam/CS:GO bot made with Javascript to interact with the CS:GO-Game-Coordinator.


# How does it work?
You have to clone the repository and make a .env in the root folder of the project.
In the .env file you have to add:
> Token = "Your Discord Bot Token here" <br />
> username = "Your Steam Username" <br />
> password = "Your Steam Password" <br />
